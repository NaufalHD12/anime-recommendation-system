# # Anime Recommendation System - Naufal Hadi Darmawan

# ## Project Domain
# ### Background Problem
# Anime has gained immense global popularity in recent years, with thousands of titles across various genres, formats, and demographics. However, due to the sheer volume of content, users often find it challenging to discover new anime that aligns with their preferences. Traditional methods like manual searches or general recommendations often fail to capture individual tastes, leading to a suboptimal viewing experience.
# ### Why and How Should This Problem be Solved?
# A personalized recommendation system can bridge the gap by leveraging user preferences and anime attributes to provide tailored suggestions. By analyzing historical user data and anime metadata, such a system can enhance user satisfaction and engagement. Machine learning techniques, particularly content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms, can be employed to develop a robust recommendation system.
# ### Research Findings
# Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of recommendation systems in improving user satisfaction and interaction in entertainment platforms. Popular approaches include collaborative filtering, which leverages user interaction data, and content-based filtering, which relies on the attributes of items.

# 
# - **Number of Rows**: 24905 
# - **Number of Columns**: 24
# #### User Ratings Dataset
# The User Score Dataset enables various analyses and insights into user interactions with anime. By examining user ratings for different anime titles, you can identify highly-rated and popular anime among users. Additionally, you can explore user preferences and watch patterns for specific anime titles. This dataset also forms the foundation for building recommendation systems based on user ratings, helping to suggest anime that align with individual tastes.  
# - user_id: Unique ID for each user.
# - Username: The username of the user.
# - anime_id: Unique ID for each anime.
# - Anime Title: The title of the anime.
# - rating: The rating given by the user to the anime.
# 
# - Number of Rows: 24325191

# #### Univariate Analysis:
# Univariate analysis focuses on analyzing one variable at a time. Letâ€™s perform it for key columns in both user_rating_filtered and anime_filtered.

# **anime_filtered:**

# - Score Distribution

# In[15]:


sns.histplot(anime_filtered['Score'], kde=True, bins=20)
plt.title('Distribution of Anime Scores')
plt.xlabel('Score')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()


# The distribution of anime scores is skewed to the right, with a peak around 6-7. This indicates that a significant portion of anime titles receive relatively high ratings. The presence of a long tail towards lower scores suggests a substantial number of anime with lower ratings or those that are unrated (represented by a score of 0). Overall, the distribution suggests a diverse range of anime quality preferences among viewers.

# - Anime Type Distribution

# In[16]:


anime_filtered['Type'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Distribution of Anime Types')
plt.xlabel('Type')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()


# The bar chart illustrates the distribution of anime types within the dataset. TV series are the most prevalent type, followed by movies and OVAs. ONA, music videos, specials, and unknown types constitute a smaller proportion of the dataset. This visualization provides a clear overview of the different anime formats present and their relative frequencies.

# - Genre Frequency: Extract individual genres and count their occurrences.

# In[17]:


from collections import Counter
genre_counts = Counter([genre for sublist in anime_filtered['Genre_List'] for genre in sublist])
genre_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(genre_counts, orient='index', columns=['Count'])
genre_df.sort_values('Count', ascending=False).plot(kind='bar', figsize=(12, 6))
plt.title('Frequency of Genres')
plt.xlabel('Genre')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()


# The bar chart presents the frequency distribution of various anime genres. Comedy is the most prevalent genre, followed by Fantasy and UNKNOWN. Genres like Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi also have a significant presence. On the other hand, genres like Erotica, Gourmet, and Girls Love are less common. This visualization provides insights into the popularity and diversity of anime genres within the dataset.

# **user_rating_filtered:**

# - Rating Distribution

# In[18]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.histplot(user_rating_filtered['rating'], bins=10, kde=False)
plt.title('Distribution of Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()


# The histogram displays the distribution of user ratings for anime. The majority of ratings cluster around 7-8, indicating that a significant number of users tend to give higher ratings. There is a gradual decrease in frequency as the ratings move towards lower scores, with fewer users giving ratings below 5. This suggests that users generally have positive opinions about anime and are more likely to rate them positively.

# #### Multivariate Analysis:
# Multivariate analysis examines relationships between variables. For this dataset, we'll analyze interactions between variables like ratings, popularity, and scores.

# - Correlation Analysis  
# Analyze the relationships between numeric features (Score, Popularity, and rating).

# In[19]:


combined_df = user_rating_filtered.merge(anime_filtered, on='anime_id')
correlation_matrix = combined_df[['Score', 'Popularity', 'rating']].corr()

sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()


# The correlation matrix reveals insights into the relationships between the variables 'Score', 'Popularity', and 'Rating'. A strong negative correlation exists between 'Score' and 'Popularity', suggesting that as popularity increases, the average score tends to decrease. Conversely, a moderate positive correlation is observed between 'Score' and 'Rating', indicating that higher ratings are associated with higher scores. The correlation between 'Popularity' and 'Rating' is weak and negative, suggesting a minimal relationship between these two variables.

# - Score vs. Popularity  
# Examine how Score relates to Popularity.

# In[20]:


sns.scatterplot(data=anime_filtered, x='Popularity', y='Score')
plt.title('Popularity vs. Score')
plt.xlabel('Popularity')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.show()


# The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between popularity and score. There is a clear negative trend, indicating that as popularity increases, the average score tends to decrease. This suggests that highly popular anime often receive lower average scores compared to less popular ones. However, there is also a significant amount of scatter, indicating that popularity is not the sole determinant of an anime's score.

# - Rating vs. Anime Type  
# Analyze whether different anime types have different average ratings.

# In[21]:


average_rating_per_type = combined_df.groupby('Type')['rating'].mean().sort_values()
average_rating_per_type.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title('Average Rating by Anime Type')
plt.xlabel('Type')
plt.ylabel('Average Rating')
plt.show()


# The bar chart presents the average rating for each anime type. Movies have the highest average rating, followed by TV series. Types like UNKNOWN and Music tend to have lower average ratings. This visualization suggests that movie and TV anime are generally perceived as having higher quality compared to other formats.

# - Studios by Average Rating

# In[22]:


# Group by Studios and calculate the average rating
studio_avg_rating = combined_df.groupby('Studios')['rating'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)

# Select top 10 studios by average rating
top_studios = studio_avg_rating.head(20)

# Plot the top 10 studios
plt.figure(figsize=(24, 12))
sns.barplot(x=top_studios.values, y=top_studios.index, palette="viridis")
plt.title('Top 20 Studios by Average Rating')
plt.xlabel('Average Rating')
plt.ylabel('Studios')
plt.show()


# The studios are ranked based on their average rating, with Robot Communications and Imagica Imageworks having the highest average rating, followed by UCOS, PERIMETRON, and Mimoid. The list includes a variety of animation and entertainment studios, with some well-known names like Studio Ghibli and Wit Studio, CloverWorks. The data provides a clear visual representation of the relative performance of these studios according to their average ratings.

# ## Data Preparation

# ### Preparation for Content-Based Filtering

# #### Text Vectorization (for 'Synopsis')

# Text vectorization is crucial for transforming textual data into numerical representations that machine learning models can understand. By applying TF-IDF vectorization, we can convert the textual synopses into a matrix of TF-IDF scores, capturing the importance of each word within the context of the entire dataset. This representation allows us to effectively analyze and compare anime synopses, enabling tasks like clustering, classification, or recommendation systems. Additionally, limiting the number of features to 500 helps reduce dimensionality and computational complexity, while still capturing the most relevant information.

# In[23]:


tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=500)
anime_filtered['Synopsis'] = anime_filtered['Synopsis'].fillna('')


# In[24]:


# Vectorizing the Synopsis and Name columns
synopsis_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(anime_filtered['Synopsis']).toarray()


# In[25]:


synopsis_tfidf


# #### Categorical Encoding (for 'Type', 'Studios', 'Source', 'Genre_List')

# Categorical encoding is essential for transforming categorical variables into numerical representations that machine learning models can process. One-hot encoding is a popular technique for handling nominal categorical variables like 'Type', 'Studios', and 'Source'. It creates binary features for each category, allowing the model to understand the significance of each category. Similarly, for the 'Genre_List' column, we create binary features for each genre, indicating its presence or absence in each anime. By converting these categorical variables into numerical features, we enable the model to capture the underlying patterns and relationships within the data and make accurate predictions.

# In[26]:


encoder = OneHotEncoder(drop='first', sparse_output=False)
categorical_columns = ['Type', 'Studios', 'Source']

# One-hot encoding for 'Type', 'Studios', and 'Source'
encoded_categories = encoder.fit_transform(anime_filtered[categorical_columns])

# Create binary genre features
anime_filtered['Genre_List'] = anime_filtered['Genre_List'].apply(lambda x: x.split(', ') if isinstance(x, str) else x)

# Use explode to split genres into separate rows
genre_list = anime_filtered.explode('Genre_List')['Genre_List'].value_counts().index

# Create binary features for each genre
for genre in genre_list:
    anime_filtered[genre] = anime_filtered['Genre_List'].apply(lambda x: 1 if genre in x else 0)

# Combine all binary genre columns
genre_features = anime_filtered[genre_list].values


# #### Numerical Normalization (for 'Score' and 'Popularity')

# Numerical normalization is crucial for ensuring that features with different scales contribute equally to the model's learning process. Standard scaling is a common technique that transforms numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance. By standardizing the 'Score' and 'Popularity' features, we ensure that they are on the same scale, preventing features with larger magnitudes from dominating the model's decisions. This normalization step improves the model's ability to learn complex patterns and relationships within the data, leading to more accurate predictions.

# In[27]:


scaler = StandardScaler()
numerical_features = anime_filtered[['Score', 'Popularity']]

# Normalize the numerical features
numerical_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(numerical_features)


# #### Combine All Features

# Combining all features: text (e.g., synopsis TF-IDF), categorical (e.g., encoded categories), genre, and numerical features into a single feature matrix is essential because it enables the recommendation model to leverage all available information about the anime. Each feature type captures different aspects: text features provide context from the synopsis, categorical and genre features encode descriptive metadata, and numerical features (like scores) add quantitative insights. By integrating these diverse feature sets, the model can analyze a richer, more holistic representation of the data, leading to more accurate and meaningful recommendations. Converting to a dense array ensures compatibility with algorithms that require dense input formats.

# In[69]:


from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix, hstack

# Ensure the categorical encoding is a sparse matrix (for memory efficiency)
encoded_categories_sparse = csr_matrix(encoded_categories)

# Ensure the genre features are a sparse matrix (if they are binary, they are sparse by nature)
genre_features_sparse = csr_matrix(genre_features)

# Combine all features (Text, Categorical, Genre, and Numerical)
final_features = hstack([synopsis_tfidf, encoded_categories_sparse, genre_features_sparse, numerical_scaled])

# convert everything to a dense array 
final_features = final_features.toarray()

final_features


# ### Preparation for Collaborative Filtering

# #### Encode user_id and anime_id

# Encoding user IDs and anime IDs is essential for collaborative filtering models to effectively capture user-item interactions. By assigning unique integer indices to each user and anime, we create a numerical representation that the model can process. This encoding enables the model to learn latent factors and preferences associated with specific users and items.

# In[29]:


user_lookup = tf.keras.layers.IntegerLookup()
anime_lookup = tf.keras.layers.IntegerLookup()

user_lookup.adapt(user_rating_filtered['user_id'])
anime_lookup.adapt(user_rating_filtered['anime_id'])

user_ratings_encoded = user_rating_filtered.copy()
user_ratings_encoded['user_id'] = user_lookup(user_rating_filtered['user_id'])
user_ratings_encoded['anime_id'] = anime_lookup(user_rating_filtered['anime_id'])


# #### Normalize ratings

# Normalizing the rating data is an important step when using collaborative filtering techniques for recommender systems. By dividing the ratings by 10 to scale them between 0 and 1, you're effectively accounting for differences in how individual users rate items. Some users may be more generous with high ratings, while others may be more conservative. Normalizing the ratings helps to remove this user-specific bias, allowing the collaborative filtering algorithm to better identify similarities between users and make more accurate predictions. 
# 
# This is crucial because collaborative filtering relies on finding patterns in how users rate items relative to each other, rather than just the raw rating values.

# In[30]:


user_ratings_encoded['rating'] = user_ratings_encoded['rating'] / 10.0


# #### Split the data

# Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for building robust and reliable collaborative filtering models. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the  final model's performance on unseen data. By splitting the data in this way, we ensure that the model is not biased towards the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data. The specific split ratios (80%, 10%, 10%) are common and provide a good balance between training, validation, and testing.

# In[31]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

train, temp = train_test_split(user_ratings_encoded, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
val, test = train_test_split(temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)


# #### Convert to TensorFlow datasets

# I should convert the data into TensorFlow datasets because they provide a flexible and efficient way to handle data inputs for training, validation, and testing of my machine learning models, particularly for deep learning. By creating TensorFlow datasets, I can easily shuffle the data to introduce randomness and prevent overfitting, batch the data to optimize memory usage and processing speed during training, and prefetch the data to keep the model pipeline filled and maximize GPU utilization.
# 
# These features make the training process more efficient and robust, as the model can learn from the data in small, manageable batches without having to load the entire dataset into memory at once. This is particularly important for large or high-dimensional datasets, where memory constraints can become a bottleneck. By leveraging the flexibility and performance optimizations offered by TensorFlow datasets, I can streamline my machine learning workflows and improve the overall effectiveness of my models.

# In[32]:


def create_tf_dataset(data):
    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((
        {"user_id": data['user_id'].values, "anime_id": data['anime_id'].values},
        data['rating'].values
    ))


# In[33]:


train_ds = create_tf_dataset(train).shuffle(100_000).batch(256).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
val_ds = create_tf_dataset(val).batch(256).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
test_ds = create_tf_dataset(test).batch(256).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)


# ## Modeling

# ### Content-Based Filtering

# Content-based recommendation systems use the features of the items (in this case, anime) to suggest similar items to users. The similarity is computed based on various attributes such as genres, synopsis (text features), categories (e.g., type, source), and numerical features like scores and popularity.
# 
# **How it works:**
# - Similarity Computation: Cosine similarity is calculated between all anime vectors in the final_features matrix. This measures the angle between vectors, where a smaller angle indicates higher similarity.
# - Recommendation Generation: For a given anime (input query), the algorithm retrieves other anime with the highest similarity scores, recommending them to the user.

# **Advantages of Content-Based Recommendation Systems**
# - The system can recommend items specific to a user's preferences based solely on the item they like.
# - Since the system relies on item attributes, it can recommend items even without historical user interaction data.
# - Recommendations are explainable because they are based on specific item attributes (e.g., "similar genre" or "similar synopsis").

# **Disadvantages of Content-Based Recommendation Systems**
# - New items with insufficient or no attributes/features may not be well-represented in recommendations.
# - Recommendations can become too narrow, suggesting only items very similar to the ones the user already likes (known as the "serendipity problem").
# - The system's performance heavily relies on the quality and representation of the extracted features. Poor feature engineering can lead to suboptimal results.

# In[34]:


cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(final_features)


# In[35]:


# import joblib

# # Save the cosine similarity matrix as a file
# joblib.dump(cosine_sim, 'CB_Model.pkl')


# In[36]:


cosine_sim_df = pd.DataFrame(cosine_sim, index=anime_filtered['Name'], columns=anime_filtered['Name'])
print('Shape:', cosine_sim_df.shape)
 

cosine_sim_df.sample(10, axis=1).sample(10, axis=0)


# ### Collaborative Filtering

# Collaborative filtering focuses on user-item interactions to generate recommendations. It predicts a user's preferences based on their past interactions and the interactions of similar users or items. In my implementation, I use matrix factorization with embeddings to model these interactions.

# Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:
# - User and Item Embeddings:  
# Each user (user_id) and anime (anime_id) is represented as a learned embedding vector of fixed size (embedding_dim).
# These embeddings capture latent features that represent preferences (for users) or characteristics (for anime).
# - Embedding Combination:  
# The user and anime embeddings are concatenated to form a single feature vector representing the interaction between the user and the anime.
# - Feedforward Network:  
# This concatenated vector is passed through dense layers with dropout regularization to predict the rating. The layers learn complex, non-linear relationships between the user and anime embeddings.
# - Output Layer:  
# The output layer has a single neuron that predicts a scalar value (the rating).
# - Training:  
# The model is trained on known user-anime ratings to minimize the error (e.g., mean squared error). Metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used to evaluate performance.
# - Prediction:  
# For unseen user-anime pairs, the model predicts ratings based on learned embeddings and feedforward layers.

# **Advantages of Collaborative Filtering**
# - Personalized Recommendations:
#     - It uses actual user behavior (ratings or interactions), resulting in highly personalized recommendations.
# - Domain Independence:
#     - Unlike content-based systems, it does not require domain-specific features (e.g., synopsis, genres). It solely relies on the interaction matrix.
# - Serendipity:
#     - Can recommend items a user might not have explicitly searched for but would enjoy based on similar users/items.

# **Disadvantages of Collaborative Filtering**
# - Cold Start Problem:
#     - Struggles with new users or items due to a lack of historical interaction data.
#     - This is especially challenging in sparse datasets where most users or items have limited ratings.
# - Scalability:
#     - Requires substantial computational resources for large datasets. In your case, with over 24 million user-anime interactions, training the model and computing predictions can be computationally expensive.
# - Data Sparsity:
#     - When the interaction matrix is sparse (i.e., most users rate only a few items), it may fail to capture meaningful patterns, leading to suboptimal recommendations.

# ##### Explanation of the Components
# **Embedding Layers:**  
# These layers learn dense representations of users and items that capture latent features.
# 
# **Dense Layers:**  
# These layers learn non-linear interactions between the latent features.
# 
# **Output Layer:**  
# Produces the predicted rating, which is a continuous value.
# 
# **Callbacks:**  
# - EarlyStopping: Stops training if validation loss doesn't improve for a set number of epochs.
# - ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduces the learning rate when the validation performance plateaus.

# #### Train the model

# #### Why I Use Precision?

# **Precision = (Number of Relevant Recommendations) / (Total Number of Recommendations)**
# 
# - Content-based filtering focuses on recommending items based on item features (e.g., genres, scores, etc). Precision ensures you are evaluating how effectively the system filters and recommends only relevant items.
# - Precision avoids penalizing models for not making enough recommendations, unlike recall.

# In[148]:

# I choose a relevance threshold to 7.0 because:
# - This value filters out items with low ratings.
# - It aligns with user expectations for recommending quality anime.
# 
# A precision of 80% indicates that my recommendation system performs well because most of the recommendations are considered relevant.

# ### Collaborative Filtering

# Metrics that I used:
# - **Loss (Mean Squared Error - MSE):**
#     - Definition: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted ratings and the true ratings.
#     - Formula: MSE = **Î£(y_true - y_pred)^2 / n**, where y_true are the true ratings, y_pred are the predicted ratings, and n is the number of samples.
#     - In the case of collaborative filtering, the ratings are usually on a numerical scale (e.g., 1-5 stars, 1-10 scores). This means that the model needs to predict a continuous rating value, that's why I pick MSE as the loss function.
# 
# - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
#    -  Definition: The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a measure of the average absolute difference between the predicted ratings and the true ratings.
#     - Formula: MAE = **Î£|y_true - y_pred| / n**, where y_true are the true ratings, y_pred are the predicted ratings, and n is the number of samples.
#     - MAE is more interpretable than MSE, as it represents the average rating prediction error. It's a useful metric for collaborative filtering as it directly relates to the quality of recommendations.
# 
# - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**
#     - Definition: The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
#     - Formula: RMSE = **âˆš(Î£(y_true - y_pred)^2 / n)**, where y_true are the true ratings, y_pred are the predicted ratings, and n is the number of samples.
#     - RMSE puts more emphasis on larger errors compared to MAE, making it more sensitive to outliers. It provides an interpretable scale (same as the rating scale) for understanding the model's predictive accuracy.

# Based on the images and model code, the model seems to be performing well in terms of both training and validation performance:
# - **Training and Validation Loss**:
#     - The training loss and validation loss both decrease over the epochs, indicating that the model is learning effectively and generalizing well to the validation data.
#     - The training loss and validation loss are close to each other, suggesting that the model is not overfitting to the training data.
# 
# - **Training and Validation (MAE)**:
#     - The training Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and validation MAE both decrease over the epochs.
#     - The training MAE and validation MAE are also close to each other, further indicating that the model is not overfitting.
# 
# - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
#     - The training RMSE and validation RMSE (orange line) both decrease over the epochs.
#     - The training RMSE and validation RMSE are close to each other, confirming the model's good generalization performance.

print(f"Test Mean Absolute Error: {test_mae:.4f}")
print(f"Test Root Mean Squared Error: {test_rmse:.4f}")


# - **Test Loss: 0.0164**
#     - The test loss represents the model's performance on the unseen test data.
#     - A low test loss, such as 0.0164, indicates that the model is making accurate predictions on the test set.
# 
# - **Test Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0946**
#     - The MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual ratings.
#     - A low MAE, like 0.0946, suggests that the model's predictions are close to the true ratings on average.
# 
# - **Test Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1265**
#     - RMSE is the square root of the mean squared error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual ratings.
#     - RMSE gives a higher penalty to larger errors compared to MAE, making it more sensitive to outliers.
#     - A low RMSE, such as 0.1265, indicates that the model is making accurate predictions with relatively small errors.
