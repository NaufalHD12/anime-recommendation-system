However, due to the sheer volume of content, users often find it challenging to discover new anime that aligns with their preferences. Traditional methods like manual searches or general recommendations often fail to capture individual tastes, leading to a suboptimal viewing experience.\n# ### Why and How Should This Problem be Solved?\n# A personalized recommendation system can bridge the gap by leveraging user preferences and anime attributes to provide tailored suggestions. By analyzing historical user data and anime metadata, such a system can enhance user satisfaction and engagement. Machine learning techniques, particularly content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms, can be employed to develop a robust recommendation system.\n# ### Research Findings\n# Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of recommendation systems in improving user satisfaction and interaction in entertainment platforms. Popular approaches include collaborative filtering, which leverages user interaction data, and content-based filtering, which relies on the attributes of items.\n# Link: \n# - https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1566/1/012057\n# - https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2023/2/2372.pdf\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# ## Business Understanding\n# ### Problem Statements\n# - How can we help users discover anime that matches their preferences more effectively?\n# - How can we leverage anime metadata and user behavior data to create accurate recommendations?\n# ### Goals\n# - Develop a content-based recommendation algorithm that analyzes anime attributes to suggest similar titles. The algorithm aims to achieve a precision of at least 90% precision, ensuring relevant and satisfying recommendations based on anime content.\n# \n# - Build a collaborative filtering algorithm that utilizes user ratings and preferences to recommend anime. The algorithm targets a mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.8, guaranteeing personalized and accurate recommendations for users while minimizing prediction errors in user satisfaction.\n# \n# ### Solution Statements\n# - Content-Based Algorithm  \n# Leverages anime metadata such as genres, studios, scores, etc to recommend titles similar to those a user has enjoyed.\n# \n# - Collaborative Filtering Algorithm  \n# Uses user interaction data, such as ratings, to identify patterns and recommend titles based on the preferences of similar users.\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# ## Data Understanding\n# ### Dataset Overview\n# #### Anime Metadata Dataset\n# The dataset offers valuable information for analyzing and comprehending the characteristics, ratings, popularity, and viewership of various anime shows.  \n# - anime_id: Unique ID for each anime.\n# - Name: The name of the anime in its original language.\n# - English name: The English name of the anime.\n# - Other name: Native name or title of the anime(can be in Japanese, Chinese or Korean).\n# - Score: The score or rating given to the anime.\n# - Genres: The genres of the anime, separated by commas.\n# - Synopsis: A brief description or summary of the anime's plot.\n# - Type: The type of the anime (e.g., TV series, movie, OVA, etc.).\n# - Episodes: The number of episodes in the anime.\n# - Aired: The dates when the anime was aired.\n# - Premiered: The season and year when the anime premiered.\n# - Status: The status of the anime (e.g., Finished Airing, Currently Airing, etc.).\n# - Producers: The production companies or producers of the anime.\n# - Licensors: The licensors of the anime (e.g., streaming platforms).\n# - Studios: The animation studios that worked on the anime.\n# - Source: The source material of the anime (e.g., manga, light novel, original).\n# - Duration: The duration of each episode.\n# - Rating: The age rating of the anime.\n# - Rank: The rank of the anime based on popularity or other criteria.\n# - Popularity: The popularity rank of the anime.\n# - Favorites: The number of times the anime was marked as a favorite by users.\n# - Scored By: The number of users who scored the anime.\n# - Members: The number of members who have added the anime to their list on the platform.\n# - Image URL: The URL of the anime's image or poster.\n# \n# - **Number of Rows**: 24905 \n# - **Number of Columns**: 24\n# #### User Ratings Dataset\n# The User Score Dataset enables various analyses and insights into user interactions with anime. By examining user ratings for different anime titles, you can identify highly-rated and popular anime among users. Additionally, you can explore user preferences and watch patterns for specific anime titles. This dataset also forms the foundation for building recommendation systems based on user ratings, helping to suggest anime that align with individual tastes.  \n# - user_id: Unique ID for each user.\n# - Username: The username of the user.\n# - anime_id: Unique ID for each anime.\n# - Anime Title: The title of the anime.\n# - rating: The rating given by the user to the anime.\n# \n# - Number of Rows: 24325191\n# - Number of Columns: 5\n# ### Data Condition\n# The dataset is relatively clean, with the exception of a few data quality issues. The 'Score' column, which should be numeric, contained non-numeric values like 'unknown'. These values were replaced with 0 and the column was converted to numeric. The 'Genres' column, originally a single string of genres, was transformed into a list of genres for more efficient analysis.\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# ### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# In this section, I will conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into the dataset.\n\n# %% [code] {\"execution\":{\"iopub.status.busy\":\"2024-12-18T02:36:28.227216Z\",\"iopub.execute_input\":\"2024-12-18T02:36:28.227535Z\",\"iopub.status.idle\":\"2024-12-18T02:36:42.117460Z\",\"shell.execute_reply.started\":\"2024-12-18T02:36:28.227505Z\",\"shell.execute_reply\":\"2024-12-18T02:36:42.116723Z\"}}\n# import all libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nfrom scipy.sparse import hstack\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Embedding, Flatten\n\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# #### Data Loading\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# I will load the dataset into a suitable data structure, such as a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring it is accessible for analysis.\n\n# %% [code] {\"execution\":{\"iopub.status.busy\":\"2024-12-18T02:36:42.118931Z\",\"iopub.execute_input\":\"2024-12-18T02:36:42.119442Z\",\"iopub.status.idle\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.918885Z\",\"shell.execute_reply.started\":\"2024-12-18T02:36:42.119409Z\",\"shell.execute_reply\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.917950Z\"}}\nanime = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/myanimelist-dataset/anime-dataset-2023.csv')\nuser_rating = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/myanimelist-dataset/users-score-2023.csv')\n\n# Check the number of rows and columns for the anime dataset\nprint(\"Anime Dataset:\")\nprint(f\"Rows and Columns: {anime.shape}\")\n\n# Check the number of rows and columns for the user rating dataset\nprint(\"\\nUser Rating Dataset:\")\nprint(f\"Rows and Columns: {user_rating.shape}\")\n\n\n# %% [code] {\"execution\":{\"iopub.status.busy\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.920140Z\",\"iopub.execute_input\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.920852Z\",\"iopub.status.idle\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.952728Z\",\"shell.execute_reply.started\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.920811Z\",\"shell.execute_reply\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.951886Z\"}}\nprint(\"Anime Dataset\")\nanime.head()\n\n# %% [code] {\"execution\":{\"iopub.status.busy\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.954479Z\",\"iopub.execute_input\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.954750Z\",\"iopub.status.idle\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.963637Z\",\"shell.execute_reply.started\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.954725Z\",\"shell.execute_reply\":\"2024-12-18T02:37:09.962775Z\"}}\nprint(\"User Rating Dataset\")\nuser_rating.head()\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# #### Drop Feature that less relevant\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# - **Anime Dataset**  \n# For content-based filtering, I'll use features that describe the content of the anime.

It's a useful metric for collaborative filtering as it directly relates to the quality of recommendations.\n# \n# - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**\n#     - Definition: The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n#     - Formula: RMSE = **√(Σ(y_true - y_pred)^2 / n)**, where y_true are the true ratings, y_pred are the predicted ratings, and n is the number of samples.\n#     - RMSE puts more emphasis on larger errors compared to MAE, making it more sensitive to outliers.
